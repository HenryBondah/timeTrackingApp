 # Overview
This project is a mobile-first time-tracking application built to simulate a real-world workforce management tool. As a software engineer, I created this app to deepen my understanding of mobile development with React Native, Firebase integration, and user-based permission systems.

The app allows admins to register and manage users, while regular users can clock in, clock out, and manually log their work hours. Admins can view all the logs submitted by the users they created, providing a functional and secure management experience.

Users log in with their email and password. Admins land on a dashboard where they can create users, view users they've created, and see submitted time logs. Users land on their own dashboard where they can submit clock-ins/outs, add manual time entries, and view/edit previous logs.

This project was built to learn how to create a scalable user-role-based system, handle real-time database updates, and manage data visibility between users and admins using Firebase Firestore.
