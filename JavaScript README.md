# Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to build full-featured, role-based web and mobile software using modern JavaScript tools. I created a time-tracking app where admins can manage users and view submitted logs, while users can clock in, clock out, and manually log time.

The purpose was to deepen my skills with JavaScript syntax, state management, asynchronous operations, and integration with real-time databases like Firebase. This app also highlights my ability to implement authentication, user permissions, and Firestore querying using JavaScript logic.
